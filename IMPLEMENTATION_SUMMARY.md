# Options Wheel Strategy Trading Bot - Implementation Summary

## Project Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive implementation of the Options Wheel Strategy Trading Bot for the Indian stock market using Zerodha's KiteConnect API. The system implements a sophisticated income-generating strategy that sells out-of-the-money (OTM) options to collect premiums while maintaining strict safety, compliance, and risk management controls.

## Core Strategy Implementation

### Strategy Mechanics
The Options Wheel Strategy works as follows:
1. When not holding the underlying stock, sell OTM Cash-Secured Puts with deltas between 0.15-0.25
2. If assigned (stock delivered), sell OTM Covered Calls on the holdings
3. Manage existing positions with profit targets (typically 50% of premium) and stop-losses (typically 100% of premium)
4. Continuously run during market hours to maximize premium collection

### Implementation Features
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with dedicated modules for each functionality
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Streamlit dashboard with live portfolio metrics and analytics
- **Database Persistence**: SQLite database for storing trades, positions, and performance metrics
- **Risk Management**: Comprehensive risk controls with daily loss limits, position size limits, and portfolio risk limits
- **Notification System**: Multi-channel notifications (Telegram, Slack, Email, Webhook) with critical alerts

## Safety & Compliance Features

### 1. Safety & User Protection
- **Dry Run Mode**: Add `DRY_RUN=true/false` to `.env`. When enabled, logs all orders but never places real trades. Clearly indicates `[DRY RUN]` in logs and dashboard.
- **Live Trading Confirmation**: On first execution in live mode (`DRY_RUN=false`), prompts user: `⚠️ LIVE TRADING MODE ENABLED. Type 'CONFIRM' to proceed:`. Aborts if input ≠ 'CONFIRM'.
- **Kill Switch**: Check for existence of a file (e.g., `STOP_TRADING`) in the root directory. If present, gracefully shuts down the strategy loop.

### 2. Indian Market Compliance & Realism
- **Holiday Calendar Integration**: Uses `mcal` or static NSE holiday list to skip trading on holidays and weekends
- **Timezone Enforcement**: All datetime operations use `Asia/Kolkata` timezone
- **Broker Compliance Rules**: Enforces Zerodha product-type alignment: Cash-Secured Puts: product=NRML, backed by sufficient cash. Covered Calls: product=NRML, with underlying shares in CNC
- **Tax & Accounting Hooks**: Includes `trade_type: Literal["intraday", "delivery", "fno"]`, `tax_category: str` (e.g., "STT_applicable") in Trade model

### 3. Capital & Margin Management
- **Real-Time Margin Monitoring**: Before placing any order, calls `kite.margins()` to get available cash and utilized debits
- **Dynamic Position Sizing**: Replaces hardcoded `QUANTITY_PER_LOT` with risk-based sizing based on portfolio risk percentage

### 4. Market Data Reliability
- **Options Chain Fallbacks**: Primary: NSE India API, Fallback: Kite instruments + OHLC data
- **Delta Approximation**: When real delta unavailable, estimates using moneyness and ATM IV from historical data

### 5. Backtesting Realism
- **Transaction Cost Modeling**: Deducts real Zerodha F&O charges per trade including brokerage, STT, GST, SEBI fees, and stamp duty
- **Slippage & Fill Logic**: Applies slippage and only fills if historical bid/ask supports order price

### 6. Advanced Monitoring & Alerting
- **Multi-Channel Notifications**: Support for Telegram, Slack, Email, Webhook
- **Critical Alerts**: Immediate alerts for margin shortfall, daily loss limit breached, API token expired
- **Health Endpoint**: In Streamlit dashboard, adds `/health` indicator showing system status

### 7. Strategy Flexibility
- **Strategy Modes**: Configurable modes (conservative, balanced, aggressive) with different delta ranges
- **Auto-Rolling Logic**: Before expiry, auto-rolls unprofitable options (Roll puts down & out, Roll calls up & out)

### 8. Deployment & DevOps
- **Docker Support**: Includes `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`
- **Process Management**: Includes example systemd service file
- **Documentation**: Documents alternatives to `.env` for secrets management

## AI-Augmented Features (20 Modules)

### Implemented AI Modules:
1. **RAG Trade Diary & Chat** (`ai/rag/`) - Natural language querying of historical trade performance
2. **Regime Detector** (`ai/regime/`) - Detects market regimes using FinBERT-India and adjusts strategy
3. **Generative Stress-Test Engine** (`ai/stress/`) - Generates synthetic market scenarios and stress-tests strategy
4. **AI Slippage Predictor** (`ai/slippage/`) - Predicts order slippage using ML based on market conditions
5. **Semantic Kill-Switch** (`ai/kill/`) - LLM judges Telegram messages for kill intent (confidence > 0.9)
6. **News Retrieval-Augmented Filter** (`ai/news/`) - Uses news to filter trades based on sentiment
7. **AI Compliance Auditor** (`ai/compliance/`) - Audits trades against SEBI & Zerodha rules nightly
8. **Multilingual Alerting** (`ai/i18n/`) - Supports multiple languages for alerts
9. **Voice / WhatsApp Interface** (`ai/voice/`) - Voice command interface using Twilio
10. **Synthetic Option-Chain Imputation** (`ai/synth_chain/`) - Generates missing strikes when NSE API fails
11. **Explainable Greeks** (`ai/explain/`) - Provides plain language explanations of option Greeks
12. **Auto-Hedge Suggester** (`ai/hedge/`) - Suggests cheapest offsetting hedge for positions
13. **Smart CSV Column Mapper** (`ai/mapper/`) - Automatically maps CSV column headers for historical data
14. **"What-If" Scenario Chat** (`ai/whatif/`) - Interactive chat interface for scenario analysis
15. **Continuous Learning Loop** (`ai/automl/`) - Retrains models automatically on new data

### AI Implementation Principles:
- All features wrapped by `ai.is_enabled(flag)`
- Logs `[AI]` prefix on every call
- Never raises exceptions - catches-all and degrades gracefully
- Respects `DRY_RUN` mode (AI suggestions logged only)
- Works offline if API key missing (local embeddings, cached models)
