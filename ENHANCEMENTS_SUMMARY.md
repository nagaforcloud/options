# Enhancements Summary for Options Wheel Strategy Trading Bot

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive summary of all safety, compliance, and advanced features implemented in the Options Wheel Strategy Trading Bot for the Indian stock market.

## üîê Safety & User Protection Features

### 1. Dry Run Mode
- Implemented `DRY_RUN=true/false` in `.env` configuration
- When enabled, logs all orders but never places real trades
- Clearly indicates `[DRY RUN]` in logs and dashboard
- Prevents accidental live trading during development and testing

### 2. Live Trading Confirmation
- On first execution in live mode, prompts user: `‚ö†Ô∏è LIVE TRADING MODE ENABLED. Type 'CONFIRM' to proceed:`
- Aborts if input ‚â† 'CONFIRM'
- Provides clear indication of the high-risk nature of live trading

### 3. Kill Switch Mechanism
- Checks for existence of `STOP_TRADING` file in root directory
- Gracefully shuts down the strategy loop when file is detected
- Documented in README.md for user awareness
- Allows immediate halt of trading in emergency situations

## üèõÔ∏è Indian Market Compliance & Realism Features

### 1. Holiday Calendar Integration
- Integrated `mcal` library for NSE holiday calendar
- Added config: `USE_HOLIDAY_CALENDAR=true`, `HOLIDAY_FILE_PATH=./data/nse_holidays.csv`
- Automatically skips strategy execution on holidays and weekends
- Prevents trading during market closures

### 2. Timezone Enforcement
- All datetime operations use `Asia/Kolkata` timezone
- No naive datetime operations; always timezone-aware
- Ensures proper alignment with Indian market hours

### 3. Broker Compliance Rules
- Enforced Zerodha product-type alignment:
  - Cash-Secured Puts: product=NRML, backed by sufficient cash
  - Covered Calls: product=NRML, with underlying shares in CNC
- Proper product type validation before order placement

### 4. Tax & Accounting Hooks
- Added `trade_type: Literal["intraday", "delivery", "fno"]` to Trade model
- Added `tax_category: str` (e.g., "STT_applicable") to Trade model
- Enables future P&L categorization for tax purposes
- Proper tracking for compliance reporting

## üí∞ Capital & Margin Management Features

### 1. Real-Time Margin Monitoring
- Before placing any order, calls `kite.margins()` to get:
  - `available.cash`
  - `utilised.debits`
- Added config: `MIN_CASH_RESERVE=10000`
- Never uses all available capital to maintain buffer

### 2. Dynamic Position Sizing
- Replaced hardcoded `QUANTITY_PER_LOT` with risk-based sizing
- `max_risk = portfolio_value * config.risk_per_trade_percent`
- `max_lots = max_risk / (strike_price * config.quantity_per_lot)`
- Config: `RISK_PER_TRADE_PERCENT=0.01` (1% of portfolio per trade)

## üìä Market Data Reliability Features

### 1. Options Chain Fallbacks
- Primary: NSE India API
- Fallback: Kite instruments + OHLC data
- Cache chain for `DATA_REFRESH_INTERVAL` seconds
- Prevents strategy failure due to single data source issues

### 2. Delta Approximation
- When real delta unavailable, estimates using: `moneyness = underlying_price / strike_price`, `delta = 0.5 + (moneyness - 1) * 2`
- Uses ATM IV from historical data if available
- Provides reasonable delta estimates when API data is missing

## üß™ Backtesting Realism Features

### 1. Transaction Cost Modeling
- Deducts real Zerodha F&O charges per trade:
  - Brokerage: ‚Çπ20 per executed order or 0.03% (whichever lower)
  - STT: 0.017% on sell side
  - GST: 18% on brokerage
  - SEBI turnover fee: ‚Çπ10 per crore
  - Stamp duty: Varies by state (~0.003%)
- Config: `INCLUDE_FEES_IN_BACKTEST=true`

### 2. Slippage & Fill Logic
- Applies slippage (e.g., 0.05%) to entry/exit prices
- Only fills if historical bid/ask supports order price
- Simulates partial fills for large orders
- Realistic execution simulation in backtests

## üì¢ Advanced Monitoring & Alerting Features

### 1. Multi-Channel Notifications
- Support for: Telegram, Slack, Email, Webhook
- Config: `NOTIFICATION_TYPE=telegram`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=...`, `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=...`

### 2. Critical Alerts System
- Sends immediate alerts for:
  - Margin shortfall
  - Daily loss limit breached
  - API token expired
  - Strategy loop stalled (>2x interval without heartbeat)

### 3. Health Endpoint
- In Streamlit dashboard, added `/health` indicator (green/red)
- Shows last cycle timestamp and error count
- Real-time system status monitoring

## ‚öôÔ∏è Strategy Flexibility Features

### 1. Strategy Modes
- Config: `STRATEGY_MODE=conservative` with options (conservative, balanced, aggressive)
- Maps to delta ranges:
  - Conservative: 0.10‚Äì0.15
  - Balanced: 0.15‚Äì0.25 (default)
  - Aggressive: 0.25‚Äì0.35
- Adapts strategy behavior based on market outlook

### 2. Auto-Rolling Logic
- Before expiry (e.g., DTE ‚â§ 1), auto-roll unprofitable options:
  - Roll puts down & out (lower strike)
  - Roll calls up & out (higher strike)
- Configurable via: `ENABLE_AUTO_ROLL=true`

## üöÄ Deployment & DevOps Features

### 1. Docker Support
- Added `Dockerfile` with Python 3.9-slim base image
- Added `docker-compose.yml` for multi-service deployments
- Mount volume for data/logs: `-v ./data:/app/data`

### 2. Process Management
- Included example systemd service file (`options_wheel_bot.service`)
- Auto-restart on failure
- Proper user/group configuration for security

### 3. Documentation
- Updated README.md with alternatives to `.env`:
